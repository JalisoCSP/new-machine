# Development Setup

* Check out my dotfiles: https://github.com/JalisoCSP/dotfiles

### Terminal

I'm currently using a 16" Macbook Pro

* Font size: 14
* Window size: 200x58

### Generate new SSH key

From Github settings: https://github.com/settings/keys

* Follow these steps from Github: https://docs.github.com/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
* Add public key to authorized keys in dotfiles: https://github.com/JalisoCSP/dotfiles/blob/master/ssh/authorized_keys.pub

### Install Homebrew

Double check command at: https://brew.sh/

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Clone dotfiles

Copy aliases, vim & tmux settings, etc

* Trying to use a git command will suggest installing developer tools, do this

```
git clone https://github.com/JalisoCSP/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake install
```

### Tab completion

https://oliverspryn.blog/adding-git-completion-to-zsh-60f3b0e7ffbc

TODO: This is in the dotfiles, does it need downloading?

```
# Download the scripts
curl -o ~/.dotfiles/zsh/git-completion.bash https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
curl -o ~/.dotfiles/zsh/_git https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.zsh
```

Following has already been added to ~/.zshrc

```
zstyle ':completion:*:*:git:*' script ~/.dotfiles/zsh/git-completion.bash
fpath=(~/.dotfiles/zsh $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```

### Vim packages

Nothing to do for VIM directly. Dotfiles take care of my usual set up

TODO: dotfiles have these packages already, but they don't "copy across" when cloning. Potentially because the bundles are themselves git repos, the files in the bundles aren’t added to the dotfiles git repo — hence why these folders have arrows on them in Github. For now, we're manually adding them with the following:

**ack.vim:** https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim

```
brew install ack
git clone https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/ack.vim
```

**Silver Searcher:** https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher

```
brew install the_silver_searcher
```

**ctrlp.vim:** https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim

```
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/ctrlp
```

**vim.rails:** https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails

```
git clone https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-rails
vim -u NONE -c "helptags vim-rails/doc" -c q
```

### ctags

```
brew install ctags
```

Make sure to run `:!ctags -R --languages=ruby --exclude=.git --exclude=log . $(bundle list --paths)` (dotfiles shorthand: `,ct`) in projects

### Tmuxinator

https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator

```
gem install tmuxinator
brew install tmuxinator
```

**TODO**: Setup standard tmux project in dotfiles

### Standard Gems

```
gem install bundler rails
```
